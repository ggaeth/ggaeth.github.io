This portfolio was constructed in the summer of 2018 as an effort to market myself to potential employers. 

3 years later... it's time to circle back and rework the portfolio as an ongoing side project. The plan is to update the portfolio side of things with current information and build out new areas to blog and share about hobbies. Some of my ideas are stock market tips, fantasy sports advice, blogs about golf courses, and food reviews. I hope this can function as a place to archieve my interests in a unique way.
